_Known Issues_
---
- You have to compile this source using ActivePerl 5.12 but the server needs 5.14 (x64) for quests to work. Just rename the Perl514.dll to Perl512.dll when running the server.
- NPCs will not spawn without the map files being present in the /maps/maps folder.
- NPCs will not roam unless specified in the database their roam range, and nodes placed in game.
